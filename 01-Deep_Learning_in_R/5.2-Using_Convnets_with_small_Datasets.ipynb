    "We're about to dive into the theory of what convnets are and why they have been so successful at computer vision tasks. But first, let's take a practical look at a simple convnet example. It uses a convnet to classify MNIST digits, a task we performed in chapter 2 using a densely connected network (our test accuracy then was 97.8%). Even though the convnet will be basic, its accuracy will blow out of the water that of the densely connected model from chapter 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "Importantly, a convnet takes as input tensors of shape `(image_height, image_width, image_channels)` (not including the batch dimension). In this case, we'll configure the convnet to process inputs of size `(28, 28, 1)`, which is the format of MNIST images. We do this by passing the argument `input_shape = c(28, 28, 1)` to the first layer.\n"
